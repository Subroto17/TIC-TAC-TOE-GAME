# Tic Tac Toe Game

The **Tic Tac Toe Game** is a Java-based desktop application that provides a fun and interactive gaming experience. Built using Java Swing for the graphical user interface, the game is designed with responsive visuals, real-time clock updates, and robust game logic to ensure an enjoyable user experience. 

### Features:
- **Two-Player Gameplay**: Enables two players to play on the same system with real-time feedback.
- **Winning and Draw Logic**: Checks for winning combinations dynamically and detects draw situations.
- **Interactive GUI**: Developed using Java Swing, featuring a visually appealing design and interactive buttons.
- **Real-Time Clock**: Displays the current date and time at the bottom of the game window, updated every second.
- **Restart Option**: Prompts players to restart the game or exit after a win or draw.

### Technologies Used:
- **Java Swing**: For building the graphical user interface.
- **Event Handling**: For managing button clicks and user interactions.
- **Threading**: For implementing the real-time clock functionality.

### How It Works:
1. Launch the application to open the game window.
2. Players take turns marking their symbols (X or O) on the 3x3 grid.
3. The game announces the winner or detects a draw and offers options to restart or exit.

This project demonstrates my proficiency in Java, GUI development, and logical thinking, showcasing my ability to design interactive and user-friendly applications.
